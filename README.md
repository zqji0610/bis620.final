## Installation

You can install the development version of bis620.2023 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
install_github("Yukodeng/bis620.2023")

# Or alternatively:
devtools::install_github("Yukodeng/bis620.2023")
```

***Important note:** This package assumes there is a `ctrialsgov.duckdb` file under the `/data-raw` folder. Due to file size restriction of GitHub, this file is removed from the package directory. To use the shiny app function of this package, make sure to manually add this file to the designated location.*

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(bis620.2023)
accel |> 
  head(100) |> 
  plot_accel()
```

To launch the Clinical Trials Query application, use `run_application()`. Query the clinical trials data by typing in or selecting values in the search fields:

``` r
library(bis620.2023)
run_application()
```
